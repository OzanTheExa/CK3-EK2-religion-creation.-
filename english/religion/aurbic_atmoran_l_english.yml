The Nords' scant few temples double as family homes and feasting-halls; faith is no mere hobby to be confined to a single time and place.\n\nThe Nordic gods are in three groups. The Hearth Gods govern wild and tempestuous nature; the Testing Gods, Skyrim's endless bloody battlefields; and the Dead Gods, Sovngarde, the Nordic underworld. But the Nords are careful, and know that communing with the divine is a privilege; one best used in aid of the Nords' fight for survival in the harsh reaches of Skyrim, just as the Nords fight for survival by keeping their Dragon God Alduin asleep for as long as they can."

 anuic_skaal_desc:0 "The All-Maker, God of the Skaal, is a mysterious deity revered as the wellspring of creation at the centre of the dualistic religion of Solstheim. Nature and the cycle of life and death are revered as the sacred gifts of the All-Maker. The Rituals and traditions of the Skaal honour the six great gifts of the All-Maker - flora, fauna, the sun, the earth, water, and wind. Though first worshipped by the distant ancestors of the Nords, reverence for the All-Maker is now nearly extinct. However, the isolated Skaal of Solstheim preserved the ancient beliefs throughout the ages. The All-Maker and the Adversary are comparable to Anu and Padomay leading outside scholars to categorise the faith as a local variation on the monomyth."

 dragon_cult_desc:0 "Dragon worship first appears among the Atmoran settlers of Skyrim in the Late [Glossary( 'Merethic Era', 'MERETHIC_GLOSS' )], who held The Dragon as the chief of their totemic animal pantheon. This eventually led to fervent worship of dragons themselves and especially their leader, Alduin the World-Eater, who was more than happy to renounce his world-ending duties and make their leaders the Dragon Priests rulers of his vast empire. Although the Dragon Cult proper was annihilated long ago, small pockets occasionally resurface throughout Skyrim, and rumours say that it may still live on as strong as ever in the northernmost reaches of the world..."
